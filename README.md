# Java: A Beginner’s Guide, Ninth Edition

As the name says, it is an introduction to Java programming, by Herbert Schildt, covering the main features of the language in version 17. The concepts are presented in order of complexity, and built on several realistic examples.  

# What I Have Learned? 

It would be easier to say what I did not learn from this book, as it was my "guide" for learning to program in Java. But this book was not my first contact with programming, so I think it served mainly to show me the particularities of this language and concepts that I have not covered before, such as multithreaded programming and generics. At the same time, it consolidated my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming, as the Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism were worked from the beginning to the end of the book. 

I liked the Try-This examples, because they are very captivating, in the sense that they demonstrate a particular feature, without which, that algorithm/example will not be possible. In addition, many of them become more complex as you read. For example, the Queue algorithm starts very simple, then setters and getters are added, followed by an interface, to finally be turned into a generic Queue.   


### Reading progress: 
Concluded. I come back often to review concepts. Progressively, I'm redoing the exercises.
